                      value set for vHBA Type Configuration. Fc-initiator specifies
                      vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables SCSI commands to transfer
                      data and status information between host and target storage
                      systems. * `fc-nvme-initiator` - Fc-nvme-initiator specifies
                      vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables NVMe-based message commands
                      to transfer data and status information between host and target
                      storage systems. * `fc-nvme-target` - Fc-nvme-target specifies
                      vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables
                      NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information
                      between host and target storage systems. Currently tech-preview,
                      only enabled with an asynchronous driver. * `fc-target` - Fc-target
                      specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators.
                      Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information
