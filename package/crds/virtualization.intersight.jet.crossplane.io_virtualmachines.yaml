                            over more traditional "emulated" devices, as VirtIO devices
                            require only the bare minimum setup and configuration

                      for work in progress. * `Restart` - The virtual machine will
                      be restarted only if it is in powered on state. If it is powered
                      off, it will not be started up. * `Unknown` - Power state of
