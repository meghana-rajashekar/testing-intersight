                      * `public` - Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality
                      of their credentials.This includes clients executing on the
                      device used by the resource owner,such as mobile applications,
                      installed native application or a webbrowser-based application.
                      * `confidential` - Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality
                      of their credentials.For example, this could be a client implemented
                      on a secure server withrestricted access to the client credentials.To
                      maintain the confidentiality of the OAuth2 credentials, two
                      use cases areconsidered.1) The application is running as a service
                      within Intersight. The application automatically   obtains the
                      OAuth2 credentials when the application starts and the credentials
                      are not   exposed to the end-user.   Because end-users (even
                      account administrators) do not have access the OAuth2 credentials,   they
                      cannot take the credentials with them when they leave their
                      organization.2) The application is under the control of a "trusted"
                      end-user. For example,   the end-user may create a native application
                      running outside Intersight. The application   uses OAuth2 credentials
                      to interact with the Intersight API. In that case, the Intersight   account
                      administrator may generate OAuth2 credentials with a registered
                      application   using "client_credentials" grant type.   In that
                      case, the end-user is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
                      of the   OAuth2 credentials. If the end-user leaves the organization,
                      you should revoke the   credentials and issue new Oauth2 credentials.Here
                      is a possible workflow for handling OAuth2 tokens.1) User Alice
                      (Intersight Account Administrator) logins to Intersight and
                      deploys an Intersight   application that requires an OAuth2
                      token.2) Intersight automatically deploys the application. The
                      application is assigned a OAuth2 token,   possibly linked to
                      Alice. The application must NOT expose the OAuth2 secret to
                      Alice, otherwise   Alice would be able to use the token after
                      she leaves the company.3) The application can make API calls
                      to Intersight using its assigned OAuth2 token. For example,   the
                      application could make weekly scheduled API calls to Intersight.4)
                      Separately, Alice may also get OAuth2 tokens that she can use
                      to make API calls from the   Intersight SDK through the northbound
                      API. In that case, Alice will get the associated OAuth2   secrets,
                      but not the one assigned in step #2.5) Alice leaves the organization.
                      The OAuth2 tokens assigned in step #2 must retain their validity   even
                      after Alice has left the organization. Because the OAuth2 secrets
                      were never shared with   Alice, there is no risk Alice can reuse
                      the OAuth2 secrets.   On the other hand, the OAuth2 tokens assigned
                      in step #4 must be invalidated because Alice had   the OAuth2
                      tokens in her possession.'
